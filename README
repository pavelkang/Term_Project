This is a Pokemon-theme game with two modes. The first mode is the actual
game, where you control a pokeball in a 3D maze to capture Pikachu. Pikachu
runs away from you and uses thunderbolt to stop you from getting close. You
will fight for rare candies on the maze with Pikachu. If you have rare candies, you can use Geodude, Charmander, or Caterpie's moves. If Pikachu has rare
candies, it can use thunderbolt. Try your best to capture Pikachu as soon
as possible!
The second mode is "roam mode." It is essentially a music player. You walk in
your pokemon garden and listen to pokemon songs. A place to relax.
