* Design

** Module Explanation
   - Single Player Mode
     - ball.py: 
       The main program of the game.
     - maze.py:
       An implementation of the 2D representation of the 3D maze. Stores
       essential information and serves as the bridge between the game and
       the AI.
     - AI.py:
       Implementation of algorithms that helps Pikachu determine which direc-
       tion Pikachu goes.
     - Key_Control.py
       Deals with keyboard input in the game.
     - load.py
       A helper module that has helper functions to help load sources such as
       pictures, sounds, models, textures, etc.
     - Model_Load.py
       Load 3D models and specify their positions, scale, Hpr(rotation), etc.
     - TwoDInterface.py
       Load 2D graphics and specify their positions, scale, etc.
     - util.py
       Helper functions that are used both in ball.py and roam.py.
   - Roam Mode
     - roam.py:
       The main program of the roam mode

** The Purpose
   Pokemon is probably the most popular game on all platforms so far. It has
incredible character design, plot, etc. However, one feature lacking in tra-
ditional Pokemon RPG games is that the graphics are 2D and the pace of pokemon
battle is pretty slow. So I tried to solve that problem and integrate 3D pokemon
models into my game to make pokemons come to life. However, making one complicated
pokemon battle game in 3D will involve programming skills and advanced use of
3D modelling that are beyond my ability. So I decided to break the problem.
In the roam mode, I am doing advanced 3D modelling, including using models with
alpha channel, making skybox, animating 3D models in Blender. So basically, roam
mode is more about letting my users enjoy a 3D world of Pokemons and pokemon-related
music. The single player mode involves more programming and algorithms.

** The Aproaches 
   - The roam mode is based on my dream as a Pokemon fanatic that one day I can
live in an actual world with those pokemons. So there is no similar programs
on the Internet. However, the program is based on a sample program that comes
with Panda3D module: roaming-ralph. It is about moving a 3-D character in an
environment. I added skybox, pokemon models, animations, and most importantly,
made the third-person perspective to first-person, which makes it more real.

   - The single player mode is inspired by Pacman. In Pacman, ghosts are trying
to eat you. But in this pokemon game, the computer, Pikachu, is running away 
from you. It is also based on a sample program that comes with Panda3D: ball-in
maze. I remade the 3D maze, and wrote AI for Pikachu.

** User Interface
   - In order to make 3D more real, I try to avoid 2D interface. 
     - In roam mode, there is no user interface, just instructions printed 
       on the screen and you can hide them by pressing "h."
     - In single player mode, I want the maze to stay in the center of the 
       program. Thus, I want to do my best to reduce the number of 2D widgets
       in the view, and "squeeze" the 2D stuff in the corner to prevent them
       from blocking users' views. I put pokemon pictures at the lower right
       corner, and the clock on the top right corner, because they are both
       noticeable and not view-blocking.
